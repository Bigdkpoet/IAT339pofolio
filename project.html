        <h3>Woking progress in the business interest guiding</h3>
        <p>I participated in the closed loop workflow from advertising planning to market release when I was working Tantan. <br>
          After finished writing scripts, casting, shooting, editing, post-production and geting feedback on social platforms (Facebook, Instagram, douyin and its overseas version),and obtained good feedback from market demand.</p>

        <h4>Working projct 1: elements design</h4>
        <p>When The market requirment data was collect throung the social platform,
          I gathering the information such as culture ,user favour and forbidon design elements
          form related country based on our internation market. Because UI elements design in visual communication
          is one part of my job, I need to creat strong visual reconition elements which is base on the company
          visual design guide.
          <br>
          <br>
          A good combinition between the elements disgn and the market requiments is challenge for me .
          At the same time,
          I also need to keep a nice balance between good visual feedback and resources limitation such as equipment,space,personnel and funds.

    <h3>Woking progress in the filming</h3>
    <p>In Simon Fraser University New Media Images course(IAT 202), I and my team present a black humor micro movie, Robbery, which is inspired by Quentin.

I participated in part of the scriptwriting, shooting, lighting editing and sound-mixing in the whole production process. </p>

<hr>
    <h4>Working projct 1: Pre-effect</h4>
    <p>The first step is writing scripts and constructed a whole visual guideline for the movie. The very first problem we met is the division of the story. Base on the research on a related movie like Hongkong movie in 1990 and discussions we made, The final vision of our scripts comes out with a very dramatic and darkness style. When the progress moved to cast, we met the trouble which should not happen in teamwork, which is lacking communication. Through argument with the local actor, the problem was finally solved.
    <br><br>
    Before we start shooting and editing, we made

    a shot List to determine the sequence of our film. Meanwhile, base on the casting and related environment, the shot list changed many times. In the pre-production, lighting and sound recording were also important parts. It directly affects the final quality of filming production. Therefore, as the main charge of the lighting and sound recording, I need to deeply know the combination of post-production and visual language.<br><br> Due to the limitation of equipment from the library, I met many problems, such as noise(low quality of the image because of lacking light), bad sound picking, and unpredictable shake from the stabilizer. This irreversible mistake always reminds me avoiding it in my future work and project. After all those preproduction work, all those footage were hand into my teammate for editing base on the script that we determined. With the ability of good communication and the knowledge and experience I learn from the School, I solved all those problems and gain a good relationship with a teammate. But most importantly, The feedback from the school film festival is good I learn more experience and knowledge than I expect.

<p style="color: white;padding-left: 5em;padding-right: 5em;">After finishing script, visual elements design and model seletion,
I entered the the clip, picture shooting, the part of the work could be very challenge and full of
unknown problem.For example ,While we taking footage in a public space,the enviroment and eqiutment technic issues came up frequiently .
Before submit to the market adverting,
The after effect working progress should be done rapidly and efficent.Due to almost the work are indivial work, the conflition between personal product style and
reqiurement form the comany is also the important thing in prodution.

<br>With the ability of good communication and the knowledge and experience I learn
from the School, I solving all those problem and gain a good relationship  with workmate.
But most importanly , The feedback from the marke platform is good and I eran related interest for the comapny.
<br>In return, I learn more experience and knowledge than I expect.
